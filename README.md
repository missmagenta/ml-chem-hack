# Digital Pharmacology: Predictive Modeling hackathon

The task is to predict the toxicity parameter values of chemical compounds.  
The selected parameters for model building: Ames test (mutagenic activity), and Hepatotoxicity.   
Models using CatBoost and neural networks were constructed.   
The datasets were obtained from ToxRic and open scientific publications.  
The DeepChem library was used for calculating ECFP (Extended Connectivity Fingerprints).
